# AI Patrols Lab

## About the Lab
This was the final project for an advanced programming course at Full Sail, and utilizes some proprietary code in the state-machine (for those wondering why it's not in the repo). The task was to design and implement a stealth level with various patrols. Each patrol has different modes that it can be set to.
